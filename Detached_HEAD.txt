Experimental commits can be made in DETACHED HEAD state
Ex. Assume the HEAD is currently pointnig to master and this is the last commit
Now, if we move to another commit using "git checkout <SHA1>", it means we are moving to a DETACHED HEAD state
If we create a few more commits from that commit and then if we move the HEAD back(checkout) to master, we will loose out all
the changes that were done as part of new commits 
If we create a new branch in the DETACHED HEAD state, then such commits can be preserved
