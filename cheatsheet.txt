git fetch upstream       | Fetch the change from the upstream(Not from origin but from upstream)

What if I am working on some feature. 
Another person is also workin on that feature.
I have developed 90%
I then realize, I have to take changes from person2 changes into my code and then continue working
Then I would need to send a PR after my code is complete
